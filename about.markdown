How are you doing?

My name is David Herrero, and I am a mobile app developer. I have more than six years as an Android apps programmer, which have been becoming my mean task, but from a few months ago I learned how to develop for IOS, and this, mixed with some previous experiences with cross-platform frameworks as Appcelerator Titanium, it has become my knowledge to be able to develop apps on both platforms. I worked with web services based on .NET and different types of APIs, from SOAP to REST. Also, I use to work in groups as well as alone. I like to be creative and the challenges, better if it solves a big mistake, there is my professional profile:

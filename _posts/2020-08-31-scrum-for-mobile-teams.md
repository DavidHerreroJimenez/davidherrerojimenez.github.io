Before start, a few considerations:

To write this article I based on Scrum Guide v2017, but Scrum was born in the '90s. 

In this article, I will try to focus on a mobile team who has to start a new challenging project. I chose Scrum because it is perfect for a small and adaptative team as a mobile team usually is. Having said that, let's start!

## Scrum is the agile method, isn't it?
So so, Scrum is a process framework to manage work, it is as famous as agile methods, but there are others as Kanban or Extreme Programming. However, Scrum is one of the most useful guides to get in agile on nowadays.

How does it work?

decisions based on what is known.
working iteratively to optimize and control risk
transparency, inspection and adaption
Transparency: A common understanding of what is being seen.
Inspection: Frequent inspection of artefacts by an inspector to detect deviations.
Adaptation: As soon as possible deviation becoming, adjustment is mandatory.
## How should we organise ourselves?
### The Scrum Team (small group of work)
Members:
Product Owner
Development Team
Scrum Master
Self-organizing: Teams choose how best to accomplish their work
cross-functional: Teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work.
Strengths: flexible, creative, productive.
#### The Product Owner (1 person)
Responsibilities:
Maximizing value of the product
Managing the Product Backlog:
Expressing Product Backlog items so clear
Ordering items to best achieve goals
Optimizing Development Team work value
Ensuring visibility, transparency and clarity and what work is the next of Product Backlog to all.
Ensuring the Development Team understands items.
The organization must respect his or her decisions.
Product Owner's decisions can't change the set of requirements of the Development Team.
#### The Development Team


## What Scrum looks so nice for mobile teams?
Scrum minimizes the risk in a way that it pushes the team to work iteratively, just as a chef tastes the food every few minutes to check if its salty enough.
It is based on three principles: transparency, inspection, and adaptation:
Firstly, each team member should be honest with their managers and colleges, because it guarantees to react in time, moreover, all need to agree among them specific words in which meaning is a bit tricky, you know, to do, in progress, done...
Secondly, teams require to check the Scrum artefacts and the current progress. Checking every day should be a must, but each morning, together, it could be terrific!
Finally, when teams catch something wrong, they need to be able to do changes as soon as possible to redirect the project towards a goal. 

Consequently, a true Scrum team, it will be composed of a mobile team, managers, and stakeholders, and all of them should be focused on the goal, committed with purpose and Scrum manners, and respectful for each other. So nice! The dream team...

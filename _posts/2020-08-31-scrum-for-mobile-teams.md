Before start, a few considerations:
Scrum authors: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

To write this article I based on Scrum Guide v2017, but Scrum was born in the '90s. 

In this article, I will try to focus on a mobile team who has to start a new challenging project. I chose Scrum because it is perfect for a small and adaptative team as a mobile team usually is, and also, I suppose that everyone will work from remote. Having said that, let's start!

## Scrum is the agile method, isn't it?
So so, Scrum is a process framework to manage work, it is as famous as agile methods, but there are others as Kanban or Extreme Programming (XP). However, Scrum is one of the most useful methodologies to get in agile on nowadays.

## How does it work?
Scrum is an empirical method based on iterations as well as agile methods does. Therefore, our remote mobile team will take decisions only based on their acquired knowledge, and they will control risk thanks to short-term iterations.
Scrum has as fundamental principles the following ideas:
Transparency: As a common understanding and base to be successful with Scrum.
Inspection: Review periodically to do not lose your way.
Adaption: Always as soon as possible, be water, my friend. 

## How should we organise ourselves?
Suppose you are into our fully remote mobile team, this it will the Scrum Team. Also, suppose, for example, you are a developer who takes part in the Development Team, from home. In this case, you will in Scrum Team, because you are inside a sub-group named "Development Team", in which you and your colleagues expect to create a both IOS and Android mobile apps, required by a new client for Podcasting. Well, this following is the way that you should organize according to Scrum guides:

### The Scrum Team (small group of work)
It is a small group of people self-organized who are enough cross-functional to get the goal. Everyone who will be taking part in product development, there are inside this team: Workers and product leaders, but not yet the stakeholders. They will be organized by:

#### The Product Owner (1 person)
The Product Owner is both responsible and politician. They are the link from Scrum Team and Stakeholders, a person who works to get the maximum value of the product from the Development Team and ensures the transparency of the process for both Scrum Team and Stakeholders, at the same time that the organizations respect its decisions. They are the only Product Backlog manager and their accountable, they must guarantee the best looking and best understanding of Product Backlog list items.

#### The Development Team (small enough)
They are the Ant Workers! In this group, I mean, your group, you remember, aren't you? people work to create the new Podcasts apps iteratively, increment the product each Sprint. They work organized by themselves and self-managing and all they are whole accountability to get the Sprint goal. Furthermore, they must estimate the tasks to get the aim and no one can replace them for this task. Scrum determines no sub-groups inside Development Team, however, in a mobile team who work in an app for more than one platform, typically will have at least an Android developer, an IOS developer, a Backend developer and a designer. Some of them also have a QA tester.

#### The Scrum Master
They are the Moses of Scrum, they explain to everyone the benefits of Scrum methodology, guide the Scrum Team across the creational process until getting the objective, and protect the Scrum Team from unhelpful interactions. 
They service to Product Owner ensuring a good understanding of Product Backlog items and planning by Scrum Team and all around them, and helping Product Owner to increase the Product Backlog value. Concerning Development Team they service to coach them about Scrum organizations and events, and also, resolving progress obstacles. Moreover, Scrum Master service organization to understand and adopt Scrum methodology.

## What about Scrum events?
At this point, you may suspicious about the title of this article. Do not worry my friend, Scrum events are when the remote condition of our team comes to play. Here we go!

Either everyone is fully remote, or they prefer to work in a partial remote, our mobile team must communicate fluency minimizing misunderstandings, manage progress without Post-its, and meeting all together with reliability. It is not a post about how wonderful is some videoconference tool. Each team should decide their tools by themselves. Nevertheless, our archetypal mobile team will use an instant messaging tool, an online multi-user Scrum board, and a video conferencing tool. First, an instant messaging for fast communications, so informal, as well as each member could communicate each other to greet in the morning, say you are going to make a coffee, or simply ask anything quickly. Secondly,  multi-user Scrum board as a substitute a physic board. This is a bit personal because there are other methods to implement Scrum no so similar to kanban, instead, this is our preference for this example. And thirdly, a good tool for meetings, basically they need some tool that allows them to do the meeting all at once, minimizing sound problems or video freezing. That said, common with Scrum events. 

Scrum defines 5 different events to manage the empirical control minimizing risk and waste of time in meetings. The Scrum events allow the Scrum Team to be transparent, inspect periodically and adopt just in time. The Scrum events are as follows:

### The Sprint
The most important event of Scrum, in which the other events are into. The scrum guide determines a maximum time of 1 month for each Sprint, but in our case, our team have decided that it will be nine days, from Friday to Thursday. Starting on Friday is important because Scrum requires to invest some hours per Sprint to meetings, and I think that the best day for meetings is Friday, in which companies usually take as a part-time day.   

During the Sprint the Development team will work on an increment of the product which they need to be able to finish in this time, also, the other members of Scrum Time will work to ensure the Sprint goal. For each Sprint is mandatory that nobody does nothing to endanger the Sprint Goal, of course, if it does something wrong with the scope, both Team Development and Product Owner must find a solution. If any reason deprecates the Sprint Goal, this Sprint could be cancelled but only by Product Owner.

The Sprints are the reason way Scrum minimize risks and , therefore, costs. The next events are considered to accomplish each Sprints aim and assurance not going wrong:

#### Sprint Planning
Scrum Team must create a plan which indicates the work to be permormed during the Sprint.
time-boxed: max 8 hours for a 1 month Sprint
Scrum Master is responsible 
Scrum Master teach Scrum Team to keep it within time-box
Answer:
What can be done this Sprint?
Development Team forecast the functionality that will develop during the Sprint.
Product Owner discuss the objective and the Product Backlogk items to achieve the Sprint Goal
Scrum Team collaborates to understand the work of the Sprint.
Only Development Team decide what Product Backlog items select from to Sprint.
The Sprint Goal is crafted by Scrum Team during Sprint Planning.
How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
How it will build into a "Done" product Increment.
Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called Sprint Backlog.
...
#### Sprint Goal
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog 
It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
created during the Sprint Planning meeting
The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal.
If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

#### Daily Scrum






## What Scrum looks so nice for mobile teams?
Scrum minimizes the risk in a way that it pushes the team to work iteratively, just as a chef tastes the food every few minutes to check if its salty enough.
It is based on three principles: transparency, inspection, and adaptation:
Firstly, each team member should be honest with their managers and colleges, because it guarantees to react in time, moreover, all need to agree among them specific words in which meaning is a bit tricky, you know, to do, in progress, done...
Secondly, teams require to check the Scrum artefacts and the current progress. Checking every day should be a must, but each morning, together, it could be terrific!
Finally, when teams catch something wrong, they need to be able to do changes as soon as possible to redirect the project towards a goal. 

Consequently, a true Scrum team, it will be composed of a mobile team, managers, and stakeholders, and all of them should be focused on the goal, committed with purpose and Scrum manners, and respectful for each other. So nice! The dream team...

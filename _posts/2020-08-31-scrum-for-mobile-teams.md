Before start, a few considerations:
Scrum authors: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

To write this article I based on Scrum Guide v2017, but Scrum was born in the '90s. 

In this article, I will try to focus on a mobile team who has to start a new challenging project. I chose Scrum because it is perfect for a small and adaptative team as a mobile team usually is, and also, I suppose that everyone will work from remote. Having said that, let's start!

## Scrum is the agile method, isn't it?
So so, Scrum is a process framework to manage work, it is as famous as agile methods, but there are others as Kanban or Extreme Programming (XP). However, Scrum is one of the most useful methodologies to get in agile on nowadays.

## How does it work?
Scrum is an empirical method based on iterations as well as agile methods does. Therefore, our remote mobile team will take decisions only based on their acquired knowledge, and they will control risk thanks to short-term iterations.
Scrum has as fundamental principles the following ideas:
Transparency: As a common understanding and base to be successful with Scrum.
Inspection: Review periodically to do not lose your way.
Adaption: Always as soon as possible, be water, my friend. 

## How should we organise ourselves?
Suppose you are into our fully remote mobile team, this it will the Scrum Team. Also, suppose, for example, you are a developer who takes part in the Development Team, from home. In this case, you will in Scrum Team, because you are inside a sub-group named "Development Team", in which you and your colleagues expect to create a both IOS and Android mobile apps, required by a new client for Podcasting. Well, this following is the way that you should organize according to Scrum guides:

### The Scrum Team (small group of work)
It is a small group of people self-organized who are enough cross-functional to get the goal. Everyone who will be taking part in product development, there are inside this team: Workers and product leaders, but not yet the stakeholders. They will be organized by:

#### The Product Owner (1 person)
The Product Owner is both responsible and politician. They are the link from Scrum Team and Stakeholders, a person who works to get the maximum value of the product from the Development Team and ensures the transparency of the process for both Scrum Team and Stakeholders, at the same time that the organizations respect its decisions. They are the only Product Backlog manager and their accountable, they must guarantee the best looking and best understanding of Product Backlog list items.

#### The Development Team (small enough)
They are the Ant Workers! In this group, I mean, your group, you remember, aren't you? people work to create the new Podcasts apps iteratively, increment the product each Sprint. They work organized by themselves and self-managing and all they are whole accountability to get the Sprint goal. Furthermore, they must estimate the tasks to get the aim and no one can replace them for this task. Scrum determines no sub-groups inside Development Team, however, in a mobile team who work in an app for more than one platform, typically will have at least an Android developer, an IOS developer, a Backend developer and a designer. Some of them also have a QA tester.

#### The Scrum Master
Promoting and supporting Scrum
Helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules and values
Helping those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren't.
Scrum Master service:
To the Product Owner:
Ensuring everyone undertand the goals, scope and product domain.
Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
Helping Scrum team understand Product Backlog items
Understanding product planning
Ensuring Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
Understanding and practicing agility
Facilitating Scrum events
To the Development Team:
Coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
Helping to create high-value products
Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress
Facilitating Scrum events
Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.
To the Organization:
Leading and coaching Scrum adoption
Planning Scrum implementations
Helping employees and stackeholders understand Scrum
Causing change that increases the productivity
Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness
## What about Scrum events?
Scrum prescribe some events to create regularity and minimize meetings not defined. All events are time-boxed. Remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved without waste time.

### The Sprint
The main characteristic of Scrum
time-boxed: 1 month or less
time during a product Increment is created ("Done")
Contain and consist:
Sprint Planning
Daily Scrum
Developmnet work
Sprint Review
Sprint Restrospective
During the Spring:
No changes that would endanger the Sprint Goal
Quality goals do not drecrease
Scope may be clarified and re-negotated between Product Owner and Development Teams as mor is learned
Each Spring may be considered a project
Used to accomplish something
Each Sprint has a goal, a design and flexible plan
Spring enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month
Sprint limit risk to one month of cost
#### Canceling a Sprint
Can be cancelled before time-box is over
Only the Product Owner has the authority
Would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
When Sprint is cancelled, completed and Done Product Backlog items are reviewed. If the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it.
Incomplete Product Backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.
Sprint cancellations consume resources
#### Sprint Planning
Scrum Team must create a plan which indicates the work to be permormed during the Sprint.
time-boxed: max 8 hours for a 1 month Sprint
Scrum Master is responsible 
Scrum Master teach Scrum Team to keep it within time-box
Answer:
What can be done this Sprint?
Development Team forecast the functionality that will develop during the Sprint.
Product Owner discuss the objective and the Product Backlogk items to achieve the Sprint Goal
Scrum Team collaborates to understand the work of the Sprint.
Only Development Team decide what Product Backlog items select from to Sprint.
The Sprint Goal is crafted by Scrum Team during Sprint Planning.
How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
How it will build into a "Done" product Increment.
Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called Sprint Backlog.
...
#### Sprint Goal
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog 
It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
created during the Sprint Planning meeting
The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal.
If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

#### Daily Scrum






## What Scrum looks so nice for mobile teams?
Scrum minimizes the risk in a way that it pushes the team to work iteratively, just as a chef tastes the food every few minutes to check if its salty enough.
It is based on three principles: transparency, inspection, and adaptation:
Firstly, each team member should be honest with their managers and colleges, because it guarantees to react in time, moreover, all need to agree among them specific words in which meaning is a bit tricky, you know, to do, in progress, done...
Secondly, teams require to check the Scrum artefacts and the current progress. Checking every day should be a must, but each morning, together, it could be terrific!
Finally, when teams catch something wrong, they need to be able to do changes as soon as possible to redirect the project towards a goal. 

Consequently, a true Scrum team, it will be composed of a mobile team, managers, and stakeholders, and all of them should be focused on the goal, committed with purpose and Scrum manners, and respectful for each other. So nice! The dream team...

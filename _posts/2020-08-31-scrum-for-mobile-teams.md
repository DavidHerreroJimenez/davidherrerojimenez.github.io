What Scrum looks so nice for mobile teams?
Scrum minimizes the risk in a way that it pushes the team to work iteratively, just as a chef tastes the food every few minutes to check if its salty enough.

Finally, when teams catch something wrong, they need to be able to do changes as soon as possible to redirect the project towards a goal.

Before start, a few considerations:
Scrum authors: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

To write this article I based on Scrum Guide v2017, but Scrum was born in the '90s. 

In this article, I will try to focus on a mobile team who has to start a new challenging project. I chose Scrum because it is perfect for a small and adaptative team as a mobile team usually is. Having said that, let's start!

## Scrum is the agile method, isn't it?
So so, Scrum is a process framework to manage work, it is as famous as agile methods, but there are others as Kanban or Extreme Programming. However, Scrum is one of the most useful guides to get in agile on nowadays.

How does it work?

decisions based on what is known.
working iteratively to optimize and control risk
transparency, inspection and adaption
Transparency: A common understanding of what is being seen.
Inspection: Frequent inspection of artefacts by an inspector to detect deviations.
Adaptation: As soon as possible deviation becoming, adjustment is mandatory.
## How should we organise ourselves?
### The Scrum Team (small group of work)
Members:
Product Owner
Development Team
Scrum Master
Self-organizing: Teams choose how best to accomplish their work
cross-functional: Teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work.
Strengths: flexible, creative, productive.
#### The Product Owner (1 person)
Responsibilities:
Maximizing value of the product
Managing the Product Backlog:
Expressing Product Backlog items so clear
Ordering items to best achieve goals
Optimizing Development Team work value
Ensuring visibility, transparency and clarity and what work is the next of Product Backlog to all.
Ensuring the Development Team understands items.
The organization must respect his or her decisions.
Product Owner's decisions can't change the set of requirements of the Development Team.
#### The Development Team (small enough)
People who work to create a project
Self-organizing, self-managing
Turn Product Backlog into Increments
cross-functional --> all skills necessaries to create a product increment
no titles
no sub-teams
accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole
Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog
#### The Scrum Master
Promoting and supporting Scrum
Helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules and values
Helping those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren't.
Scrum Master service:
To the Product Owner:
Ensuring everyone undertand the goals, scope and product domain.
Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
Helping Scrum team understand Product Backlog items
Understanding product planning
Ensuring Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
Understanding and practicing agility
Facilitating Scrum events
To the Development Team:
Coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
Helping to create high-value products
Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress
Facilitating Scrum events
Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.
To the Organization:
Leading and coaching Scrum adoption
Planning Scrum implementations
Helping employees and stackeholders understand Scrum
Causing change that increases the productivity
Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness
## What about Scrum events?
Scrum prescribe some events to create regularity and minimize meetings not defined. All events are time-boxed. Remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved without waste time.

### The Sprint
The main characteristic of Scrum
time-boxed: 1 month or less
time during a product Increment is created ("Done")
Contain and consist:
Sprint Planning
Daily Scrum
Developmnet work
Sprint Review
Sprint Restrospective
During the Spring:
No changes that would endanger the Sprint Goal
Quality goals do not drecrease
Scope may be clarified and re-negotated between Product Owner and Development Teams as mor is learned
Each Spring may be considered a project
Used to accomplish something
Each Sprint has a goal, a design and flexible plan
Spring enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month
Sprint limit risk to one month of cost
#### Canceling a Sprint
Can be cancelled before time-box is over
Only the Product Owner has the authority
Would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
When Sprint is cancelled, completed and Done Product Backlog items are reviewed. If the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it.
Incomplete Product Backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.
Sprint cancellations consume resources
#### Sprint Planning
Scrum Team must create a plan which indicates the work to be permormed during the Sprint.
time-boxed: max 8 hours for a 1 month Sprint
Scrum Master is responsible 
Scrum Master teach Scrum Team to keep it within time-box
Answer:
What can be done this Sprint?
Development Team forecast the functionality that will develop during the Sprint.
Product Owner discuss the objective and the Product Backlogk items to achieve the Sprint Goal
Scrum Team collaborates to understand the work of the Sprint.
Only Development Team decide what Product Backlog items select from to Sprint.
The Sprint Goal is crafted by Scrum Team during Sprint Planning.
How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
How it will build into a "Done" product Increment.
Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called Sprint Backlog.
...
#### Sprint Goal
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog 
It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
created during the Sprint Planning meeting
The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal.
If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

#### Daily Scrum






## What Scrum looks so nice for mobile teams?
Scrum minimizes the risk in a way that it pushes the team to work iteratively, just as a chef tastes the food every few minutes to check if its salty enough.
It is based on three principles: transparency, inspection, and adaptation:
Firstly, each team member should be honest with their managers and colleges, because it guarantees to react in time, moreover, all need to agree among them specific words in which meaning is a bit tricky, you know, to do, in progress, done...
Secondly, teams require to check the Scrum artefacts and the current progress. Checking every day should be a must, but each morning, together, it could be terrific!
Finally, when teams catch something wrong, they need to be able to do changes as soon as possible to redirect the project towards a goal. 

Consequently, a true Scrum team, it will be composed of a mobile team, managers, and stakeholders, and all of them should be focused on the goal, committed with purpose and Scrum manners, and respectful for each other. So nice! The dream team...

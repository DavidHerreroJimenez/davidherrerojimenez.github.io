## Before start, a few considerations:
Scrum authors: Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

To write this article I based on Scrum Guide v2017, but Scrum was born in the '90s. 

In this article, I will try to focus on a mobile team who has to start a new challenging project. I chose Scrum because it is perfect for a small and adaptative team as a mobile team usually is, and also, I suppose that everyone will work from remote. Having said that, let's start!

## Scrum is the agile method, isn't it?
So so, Scrum is a process framework to manage work, it is as famous as agile methods, but there are others as Kanban or Extreme Programming (XP). However, Scrum is one of the most useful methodologies to get in agile on nowadays.

## How does it work?
Scrum is an empirical method based on iterations as well as agile methods does. Therefore, our remote mobile team will take decisions only based on their acquired knowledge, and they will control risk thanks to short-term iterations.
Scrum has as fundamental principles the following ideas:
Transparency: As a common understanding and base to be successful with Scrum.
Inspection: Review periodically to do not lose your way.
Adaption: Always as soon as possible, be water, my friend. 

## How should we organise ourselves?
Suppose you are into our fully remote mobile team, this it will the Scrum Team. Also, suppose, for example, you are a developer who takes part in the Development Team, from home. In this case, you will in Scrum Team, because you are inside a sub-group named "Development Team", in which you and your colleagues expect to create a both IOS and Android mobile apps, required by a new client for Podcasting. Well, this following is the way that you should organize according to Scrum guides:

### The Scrum Team (small group of work)
It is a small group of people self-organized who are enough cross-functional to get the goal. Everyone who will be taking part in product development, there are inside this team: Workers and product leaders, but not yet the stakeholders. They will be organized by:

#### The Product Owner (1 person)
The Product Owner is both responsible and politician. They are the link from Scrum Team and Stakeholders, a person who works to get the maximum value of the product from the Development Team and ensures the transparency of the process for both Scrum Team and Stakeholders, at the same time that the organizations respect its decisions. They are the only Product Backlog manager and their accountable, they must guarantee the best looking and best understanding of Product Backlog list items.

#### The Development Team (small enough)
They are the Ant Workers! In this group, I mean, your group, you remember, aren't you? people work to create the new Podcasts apps iteratively, increment the product each Sprint. They work organized by themselves and self-managing and all they are whole accountability to get the Sprint goal. Furthermore, they must estimate the tasks to get the aim and no one can replace them for this task. Scrum determines no sub-groups inside Development Team, however, in a mobile team who work in an app for more than one platform, typically will have at least an Android developer, an IOS developer, a Backend developer and a designer. Some of them also have a QA tester.

#### The Scrum Master
They are the Moses of Scrum, they explain to everyone the benefits of Scrum methodology, guide the Scrum Team across the creational process until getting the objective, and protect the Scrum Team from unhelpful interactions. 
They service to Product Owner ensuring a good understanding of Product Backlog items and planning by Scrum Team and all around them, and helping Product Owner to increase the Product Backlog value. Concerning Development Team they service to coach them about Scrum organizations and events, and also, resolving progress obstacles. Moreover, Scrum Master service organization to understand and adopt Scrum methodology.

## What about Scrum events?
At this point, you may suspicious about the title of this article. Do not worry my friend, Scrum events are when the remote condition of our team comes to play. Here we go!

Either everyone is fully remote, or they prefer to work in a partial remote, our mobile team must communicate fluency minimizing misunderstandings, manage progress without Post-its, and meeting all together with reliability. It is not a post about how wonderful is some videoconference tool. Each team should decide their tools by themselves. Nevertheless, our archetypal mobile team will use an instant messaging tool, an online multi-user Scrum board, and a video conferencing tool. First, an instant messaging for fast communications, so informal, as well as each member could communicate each other to greet in the morning, say you are going to make a coffee, or simply ask anything quickly. Secondly,  multi-user Scrum board as a substitute a physic board. This is a bit personal because there are other methods to implement Scrum no so similar to kanban, instead, this is our preference for this example. And thirdly, a good tool for meetings, basically they need some tool that allows them to do the meeting all at once, minimizing sound problems or video freezing. That said, common with Scrum events. 

Scrum defines 5 different events to manage the empirical control minimizing risk and waste of time in meetings. The Scrum events allow the Scrum Team to be transparent, inspect periodically and adopt just in time. The Scrum events are as follows:

### The Sprint
The most important event of Scrum, in which the other events are into. The scrum guide determines a maximum time of 1 month for each Sprint, but in our case, our team have decided that it will be nine days, from Friday to Thursday. Starting on Friday is important because Scrum requires to invest some hours per Sprint to meetings, and I think that the best day for meetings is Friday, in which companies usually take as a part-time day.   

During the Sprint the Development team will work on an increment of the product which they need to be able to finish in this time, also, the other members of Scrum Time will work to ensure the Sprint goal. For each Sprint is mandatory that nobody does nothing to endanger the Sprint Goal, of course, if it does something wrong with the scope, both Team Development and Product Owner must find a solution. If any reason deprecates the Sprint Goal, this Sprint could be cancelled but only by Product Owner.

The Sprints are the reason way Scrum minimize risks and, therefore, costs. The next events are considered to accomplish each Sprints aim and assurance not going wrong:

#### Sprint Planning
All Scrum Team will have a meeting to define a Sprint Goal and develop a plan to achieve this goal. For this meeting, the Scrum guide allow 8 hours as a maximum per month. Instead, our mobile team has 2-week Sprints that start and finalizing on Friday, and we assumed Fridays as a half working day, so our Scrum team will have 1 hour as a maximum per Sprint. Scrum Master will look after the Scrum Team respect this time as well as the aim of this meeting.  During the Sprint Planning, it is time for Development Team to select the next tasks to do from Product Backlog, always close to Product Owner who leads the team regarding the best choices to aim to next Sprint Goal.
 
#### Sprint Goal
Each project has its goals. The Sprint Goal represents the happy end for Development Team, who will be working hard throughout the Sprint to achieve the planned increment. It is defined during Sprint Planning.

#### Daily Scrum
It is a 15-minute meeting to plan the daily work and check the Sprint progress. It is for Development Team whereas  Scrum Master ensures its carry out.  Better if is the first task every morning at the same time, just before starting to work with a good coffee.

#### Sprint Review
It is a meeting in which the assistants are composed by Scrum Team and the Stakeholders invited by the Product Owner. The objective is reviewing the milestones achieved, issues and solutions found. Furthermore, this meeting will be useful to start to prepare the next Sprint Planning and compare progress with the estimated delivery date. After Sprint review the Background Backlog is updated. Scrum guide determines 4 hours per 1-month  Sprint. In our case, there is max 30 min.

#### Sprint Retrospective
After the Sprint Review, Sprint retrospective will be useful for the Scrum Team to improve their workflow from acquired knowledge in the last Sprint to next Sprint. Scrum Guide determines max 3 hours per Sprint month. Here, our time will spend 30 minutes as well as Sprint Review, and Scrum Master is responsible for this meeting.


## At last, How much time will spend our mobile team in video calls?
As a result, we said before, our mobile team will spend as a maximum 4 hours and 15 minutes each Sprint, pretty well, don't you think so? Remember that our mobile team decided a 9-days Sprint plus 1 day for meetings.

## Scrum Artifacts
 Our team has organization, the events to planning the work during each iteration. Finally, we are going to talk about the Scrum Artifacts, which are some elements to manage the required tasks to achieve the objective with transparency. Go on!

#### Product Backlog
The main task list. Product Backlog is when all task and requirements are and the base for the development with Scrum methodology. The Product Owner is the maintainer. It is the first list to create before starting the project.

#### Sprint Backlog
As a result of Sprint Planning, the Sprint Backlog is a list when the team stack the tasks to do throughout the Sprint. 

#### Increment
The increment is the result of the Development Team working hours throughout the Sprint, it is new functionality for our mobile apps, which contribute to up the value of the project.

## Definition of "Done"
Scrum Guide defines as a Done, each finished increment, but there is a task for every team to set up the own "Done" definition.

## Conclusions
### What Scrum looks so nice for mobile teams?
Scrum minimizes the risk in a way that it pushes the team to work iteratively, just as a chef tastes the food every few minutes to check if its salty enough.
It is based on three principles: transparency, inspection, and adaptation:
Firstly, each team member should be honest with their managers and colleges, because it guarantees to react in time, moreover, all need to agree among them specific words in which meaning is a bit tricky, you know, to do, in progress, done...
Secondly, teams require to check the Scrum artefacts and the current progress. Checking every day should be a must, but each morning, together, it could be terrific!
Finally, when teams catch something wrong, they need to be able to do changes as soon as possible to redirect the project towards a goal. 

Consequently, a true Scrum team, it will be composed of a mobile team, managers, and stakeholders, and all of them should be focused on the goal, committed with purpose and Scrum manners, and respectful for each other. So nice! The dream team...
